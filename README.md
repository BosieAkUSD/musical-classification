# Composer Identification Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Composer Identification Project! In this project, we aim to leverage deep learning techniques to accurately identify the composer of a given musical score. This project is ideal for those interested in applying machine learning to the field of music, combining technical skills with an appreciation for classical compositions.

## Objective

The primary objective is to develop a deep learning model that can predict the composer of a musical score. We will be using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to achieve this.

## Team Members

- *** Bosie Akioyamen ***
- *** Tursun Alkam, PhD *** 

## Dataset

We will be using a dataset that includes MIDI files and sheet music from classical composers such as Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Schubert, etc. Each musical score will be labeled with the composer's name.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Data Collection
- **Task:** Obtain and organize the provided dataset.
- **Action:** Ensure all team members have access to the dataset.

### Step 2: Data Pre-processing
- **Task:** Convert musical scores into a format suitable for deep learning.
- **Action:** Convert scores to MIDI files and apply data augmentation techniques.

### Step 3: Feature Extraction
- **Task:** Extract relevant features from the MIDI files.
- **Action:** Use music analysis tools to extract notes, chords, tempo, etc.

### Step 4: Model Building
- **Task:** Develop the deep learning model using LSTM and CNN architectures.
- **Action:** Implement and test different model architectures.

### Step 5: Model Training
- **Task:** Train the model using the pre-processed data.
- **Action:** Utilize Google Colab GPU/TPU for efficient training.

### Step 6: Model Evaluation
- **Task:** Evaluate the model's performance.
- **Action:** Use accuracy, precision, and recall metrics to assess the model.

### Step 7: Model Optimization
- **Task:** Optimize the model for better performance.
- **Action:** Fine-tune hyperparameters and re-evaluate.
